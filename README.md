My efficiency, quick problem-solving skills, effective communication, and excellent time management abilities set me apart.

I am well-versed in Agile methodologies and experienced in working remotely. Code versioning using Git is a standard practice for me, and I have worked with a wide range of stacks, including:

  - ‚≠ê Node.js
  - ‚≠ê Vue.js / ES6
  - ‚≠ê TypeScript
  - ‚≠ê Vuetify or similar material design frameworks
  - ‚≠ê React

Beyond development, I have hands-on experience in project management, deployment, monitoring, support, testing, and web application security. I am proficient in using VCS tools like Git and GitHub, and I actively contribute to various open-source repositories.


Thanks
